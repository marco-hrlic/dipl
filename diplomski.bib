@book{foucart13,
  abstract = {At the intersection of mathematics, engineering, and computer science sits the thriving field of compressive sensing. Based on the premise that data acquisition and compression can be performed simultaneously, compressive sensing finds applications in imaging, signal processing, and many other domains. In the areas of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and theoretical computer science, an explosion of research activity has already followed the theoretical results that highlighted the efficiency of the basic principles. The elegant ideas behind these principles are also of independent interest to pure mathematicians. A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing gives a detailed account of the core theory upon which the field is built.},
